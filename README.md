### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## What I'm working on in 2022:
Currently, I'm working on a few interesting projects and academic research at workplace and University.
- Research assistant at Exines Lab assisting on natural language and image processing for Software Engineering use cases
- Leading a discovery project and architecting a bigdata pipeline includes following tech stack:
  - **ArangoDB**, a native multimodal database to store product structures and their components as graphs and json notation documents (NoSQL)
  - **Azure RedHat OpenShift (ARO)** is a fully-managed service provided by Microsoft and RedHat jointly, for deploying, managing and supporting OpenShift      Clusters which extends Kubernetes container platform. This reduces operational overhead and focus on quickly delivering applications that provide more      value to their business.
  - **Apache Kafka and Debezium**, an open source distributed platforms for real-time data ingestion from source systems
  - **Argo CD** is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It follows the GitOps pattern of using Git repositories as the source of      truth for defining the desired application state. It automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments.
  - **ReactJS Frontend Application**, a custom web application serving as data discovery platform
  - **Graphistry**, GPU cloud based visual graph analytics tool embedded in ReactJs
